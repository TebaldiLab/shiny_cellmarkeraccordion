**In order to run the App you have to download the entire repository "shiny_cellmarkeraccordion" e run the "app.R" script.** 

The Cell Marker Accordion web interface allows to easily:

The app allows the user to upload its custom sets of positive and/or negative set marker genes to be integrated into the Accordion repository.

database specificity and by their evidence consistency scores


User can upload a file containing markers for every cluster, or just related to one entity, and the tool retrieves the respective cell type with the highest correlation.
